When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:\r\n","\r\n","* If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.\r\n","\r\n","* If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.\r\n","\r\n","When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:\r\n","\r\n","## Loan accepted: \r\n","\r\n","If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:\r\n","\r\n","Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)\r\n","\r\n","## Current: \r\n","\r\n","Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.\r\n","\r\n","## Charged-off: \r\n","\r\n","Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan \r\n","\r\n","## Loan rejected: \r\n","\r\n","The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.). Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset).\r\n","\r\n","## Business Objectives\r\n","\r\n","* This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. \r\n","\r\n"," \r\n","\r\n","* Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. \r\n","\r\n"," \r\n","\r\n","* If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.\r\n","\r\n"," \r\n","\r\n","* In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. \r\n","\r\n","\r\n","* To develop your understanding of the domain, you are advised to independently research a little about risk analytics (understanding the types of variables and their significance should be enough)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gHC3towh5fhy"},"source":["### as part of data analysis lets import the data from data folder.\r\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"gA8V3WX66TO3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1610276778428,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1670,"user":{"displayName":"Srikanth Popuri","photoUrl":"","userId":"00355189322552409476"}},"outputId":"faa62f8b-fa1e-4713-f255-bce58df42e08"},"source":["import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n","import os\n","os.listdir('data/')"],"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['Data_Dictionary.xlsx', 'loan.csv']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"e2y9P_Ga8sfN"},"source":["## Analysis approach:\r\n","### The approach involves understanding data, which means exploratory data analysis and also visualising the data. so \r\n","### lets import all the packages needed to do the required operations."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8dNAkvz99cft","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1610276779073,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2299,"user":{"displayName":"Srikanth Popuri","photoUrl":"","userId":"00355189322552409476"}}},"source":["# operation packages\r\n","import numpy as np\r\n","import pandas as pd\r\n","\r\n","#plotting and visualisation\r\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n","import seaborn as sns\r\n","\r\n"],"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"p1sBO1ad9sas"},"source":["## as part of understanding data import the data and convert to dataframes."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":610},"id":"Y5SO87eZ97Y8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1610276779781,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2998,"user":{"displayName":"Srikanth Popuri","photoUrl":"","userId":"00355189322552409476"}},"outputId":"304fde36-952c-4a1f-9f02-4fd5aedb0b12"},"source":["data = pd.read_csv('data/loan.csv', encoding='iso-8859-1')\n","data.head()"],"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        id  member_id  loan_amnt  funded_amnt  funded_amnt_inv        term  \\\n","0  1077501    1296599       5000         5000           4975.0   36 months   \n","1  1077430    1314167       2500         2500           2500.0   60 months   \n","2  1077175    1313524       2400         2400           2400.0   36 months   \n","3  1076863    1277178      10000        10000          10000.0   36 months   \n","4  1075358    1311748       3000         3000           3000.0   60 months   \n","\n","  int_rate  installment grade sub_grade  ... num_tl_90g_dpd_24m  \\\n","0   10.65%       162.87     B        B2  ...
